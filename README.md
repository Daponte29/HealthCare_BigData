The experiments are conducted on a large and publicly available
dataset, namely the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive
Care (MIMIC-3 v1.4) database. MIMIC-3 encompasses
a very large population of patients compared to other public EHRs.
It contains hospital admissions of 43K patients in critical care units
during 2001 and 2012, involving 6,695 distinct diseases and 4,127
drugs.
